# Investigative Learning Protocol (Dynamical Systems Edition)

This document defines the generalized process for improving mental models and resolving performance gaps, grounded in **Dynamical Systems Theory**.

## Core Philosophy
Learning is the process of moving from **Surface Perception** (dogma, rules, cheap signals) to **Systemic Perception** (mechanics, energy, costly signals). We treat every skill as a dynamical system with its own attractors, bifurcations, and metabolism.

## Operational Subroutines

### Subroutine: SYSTEMIC_EVALUATION (The Fermi Method)
When evaluating a state, do not calculate; audit the **Weights** of the system.
1. **IDENTIFY:** List the relevant factors ($f_i$) in the current state.
2. **WEIGHT:** Assign "Fermi Weights" ($w_i$) based on the system's phase (e.g., in a crisis, $w_{safety} \gg w_{efficiency}$).
3. **COMPUTE:** $Eval = \sum w_i f_i$. If the result is uncertain, you are likely at a **Bifurcation Point**.

### Subroutine: OPERATIONAL_AUDITS
Use these tools to bypass "Thinking" and see the underlying reality:
- **Mechanical Empathy:** "Talk to the pieces." Audit the functional needs of every component in the system. If they are unhappy, the system is brittle.
- **Zahavian Signaling:** Distinguish between **Cheap Signals** (easily faked dogmas) and **Costly Signals** (handicaps that prove underlying fitness). Look for what the system *costs* to maintain its state.

### Subroutine: BIFURCATION_MANAGEMENT
Identify points where the system's fundamental nature is about to change:
1. **DETECT:** Look for major structural shifts (trades, breaks, transitions).
2. **RESET:** Treat the post-bifurcation state as a "Fresh Board." Let the old "story" die.
3. **RE-WEIGHT:** Immediately re-calculate the Fermi Weights for the new phase.

### Subroutine: GAP_RESOLUTION (Scientific Method)
When a recurring error or an unexplained phenomenon is identified, create a directory in `gaps/{gap-name}/` and execute:
1. **1-question.md:** Define the mystery. Why do current models fail?
2. **2-hypothesis.md:** Propose a falsifiable candidate model (look for **Structural Isomorphisms** in other domains).
3. **3-predictions.md:** List specific, testable "If/Then" outcomes.
4. **4-tests.md:** Execute "Chaotic Drills" or sessions to test the hypothesis.
5. **5-conclusion.md:** Accept, Reject, or Refine the model.

## Cross-Domain Isomorphism
Always look for structural parallels. If a mechanic works in biology or corporate forensics, it likely has a mathematical analogue in chess, tennis, or coding. The logic of **Load-Bearing Systems** and **Basins of Attraction** is universal.

## Workflow Integration
1. **Orient:** Select a **Model** to test or a **Gap** to investigate.
2. **Act:** Execute while monitoring for **Bifurcation Triggers**.
3. **Observe:** Record findings. Link to the graph: `viz` to see the dashboard.
