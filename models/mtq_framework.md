# Concept: The MTQ Framework (Material-Time-Quality)

## Description
A universal framework for decision-making under constraints. Every action involves a tradeoff between three finite resources:

1.  **Material (M):** The static assets (Chess pieces, Tennis stamina, Financial capital).
2.  **Time (T):** The temporal constraint (Clock time, Tempo, Deadlines).
3.  **Quality (Q):** The objective excellence or "Truth" of the output (Move strength, Shot accuracy, Product quality).

## The Tradeoffs
- **The Perfectionist Trap:** $Q \uparrow, T \downarrow$. Spending too much time searching for the perfect "Truth," leading to systemic collapse when the clock runs out.
- **The Materialist Trap:** $M \uparrow, T/Q \downarrow$. Clinging to assets while losing the momentum or the objective health of the system.
- **The Blitz Strategy:** $T \uparrow, Q \downarrow$. Using speed to overwhelm the opponent's ability to maintain quality.

## Dynamical Systems Perspective
In a high-energy (dynamic) state, **Time (T)** is usually the most valuable variable. In a low-energy (static) state, **Material (M)** and **Quality (Q)** become more dominant.
