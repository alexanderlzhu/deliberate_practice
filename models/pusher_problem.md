# Model: The "Pusher" Problem

## Type
Tactical / Psychological (Cross-Domain)

## Description
The tendency to over-reach or over-hit against a defensive/safe opponent ("The Pusher") out of a desire to "punish" their lack of aggression.

## Triggers (The "When")
- **Tennis:** Facing a baseline retriever who doesn't miss. Feeling frustration that "they aren't even playing real tennis."
- **Chess:** Facing a lower-rated player who plays extremely solid, trade-oriented moves. Feeling the need to "force" a win to avoid a draw.

## The Sin: Wanting & Egoism
- **Wanting:** You want the win to be a "dominance display."
- **Egoism:** You believe your "correct/aggressive" style *should* beat their "boring" style, leading you to ignore the objective risks of your own over-aggression.

## Remedies (The "How")
- **Shift the Objective:** Stop trying to "out-hit" (Tennis) or "out-calculate" (Chess) in their comfort zone.
- **Percentage Play:** Against a Pusher, your "Wanting" to hit a spectacular winner is their greatest asset. Shift your goal to "making one more ball than they do" but with better positioning (Time-Collapse).
- **Collapse Time & Space (Rushing the Net):**
    - **Tennis:** The Pusher's ball has no pace. Use that lack of pace to approach the net safely. Take the ball early, take their time away, and force them to hit a precision passing shot—the one thing they hate doing.
    - **Chess:** Stop "trading down" to avoid their solidness. Instead, create piece contact and maintain tension. Force them to navigate a "congested" board where they can't simply shuffle pieces.
- **Patience as a Weapon:** Realize that "The Pusher" wins because of *your* impatience. Acceptance of a long, boring game is often the fastest way to win it.
