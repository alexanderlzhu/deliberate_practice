# Model: Looseness (Chess Sin #7)

## Type
Psychological / Discipline

## Description
Dropping the tension. Lack of discipline in "easy" positions or when you feel the game is already decided.

## Triggers (The "When")
- A feeling of "The game is over, I've won" or "This is just a draw."
- Making moves too quickly in the endgame.

## Remedies (The "How")
- Maintain the "Plot." Every move must have a purpose.
- If you can't find a plan, improve your worst-placed piece. Stay vigilant until the handshake.
