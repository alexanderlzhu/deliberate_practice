# Model: Looseness (Chess Sin #7)

## Type
Psychological / Discipline

## Description
The "Lack of a Plot." It is the failure to maintain mental tension and purposeful direction when the position becomes "easy," "won," or "drawn."

## Triggers (The "When")
- **Premature Completion:** Thinking "I've won" or "He'll never escape" and relaxing your calculation.
- **The Fog of Simplicity:** In simple endgames, making moves just to "get through" the 40-move control without a concrete plan.
- **Tennis Parallel:** Being up 5-0 and losing the next three games because your intensity dropped 5%.

## Remedies (The "How")
- **Define the Plot:** Every move must be a chapter in a story. If you can't state what the current "story" of the game is (e.g., "Restricting his Knight"), you are being loose.
- **The "Worst Piece" Rule:** If the plot is unclear, find your worst piece and improve its potential. This creates a "mini-plot."
- **The Handshake Rule:** The game is a high-energy system until the handshake. Do not allow the "metabolism" of your thinking to slow down until the pieces are back in the box.
- **Stay in the Basin:** Realize that a "won" game is just a **Basin of Attraction**. If you stop providing energy (Calculation), the system can drift into a different, chaotic basin.
