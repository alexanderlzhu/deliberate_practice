# Model: Wanting (Chess Sin #3)

## Type
Psychological

## Description
Allowing the desire for a result (win/draw) to cloud objective evaluation. Result-oriented thinking rather than process-oriented thinking.

## Triggers (The "When")
- Thoughts like "If I win this, I gain 20 Elo" or "I just need to draw this."
- Feeling fear of losing an advantage.

## Remedies (The "How")
- Focus on the *process*. "The board doesn't know who is winning."
- Treat the position as a fresh puzzle, independent of the tournament standings.

## Observations
