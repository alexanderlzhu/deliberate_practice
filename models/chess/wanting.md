# Model: Wanting (Chess Sin #3)

## Type
Psychological

## Description
Allowing the desire for a result (win/draw) to cloud objective evaluation. Result-oriented thinking rather than process-oriented thinking.

## Triggers (The "When")
- Thoughts like "If I win this, I gain 20 Elo" or "I just need to draw this."
- **The Rating Gap:** Playing someone 200+ points lower and feeling you *must* create chaos to win.
- Feeling fear of losing an advantage or an "attachment" to a winning position.

## Remedies (The "How")
- **The Archer's Paradox (Striving without Striving):** If you shoot for the gold, your skill is divided. If you shoot for the sake of the shot, you are free. Want the *shot* (the move), not the *gold* (the win).
- **The "Fresh Board" Reset:** Imagine you are a Grandmaster who just walked up to the board. You don't know the players or the score. What is the objective move?
- **Match Mode vs. Practice Mode:** In practice, "want" to hit the difficult shot to grow. In a match, "want" the truth of your current percentages.
- **The Board is Blind:** Repeat the mantra: "The board doesn't know who is winning."
- **Wu Wei (Effortless Action):** Align your intent with the natural flow of the position. Don't "force" a win; wait for the win to emerge from a series of objective moves.
