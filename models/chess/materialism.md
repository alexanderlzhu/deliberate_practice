# Model: Materialism (Chess Sin #4)

## Type
Tactical / Philosophical

## Description
Valuing the "matter" (pieces) over the "energy" (initiative/activity). Over-attachment to material count at the expense of dynamic factors.

## Triggers (The "When")
- Reluctance to sacrifice a pawn for a clear increase in piece activity.
- Feeling "safe" just because you are up a pawn, despite being under pressure.

## Remedies (The "How")
- E=MC². Remember that "Energy" (Activity) can be converted into "Matter" (Material) later.
- Ask: "If I didn't have this extra pawn, how would I feel about my position?"

## Observations
