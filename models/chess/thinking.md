# Model: Thinking (Chess Sin #1)

## Type
Psychological / Tactical

## Description
Thinking when you should be *doing* or *feeling*. Over-calculating "dead" positions or applying dogmatic rules when intuition or concrete action is required. 

**The Sin of the Shared Game:** "Thinking" often means you are playing the game your opponent *expects* you to play. You are calculating variations in a "fight" that both players see, rather than seeking the deeper reality.

**Following Cheap Signals:** "Thinking" is often the act of being deceived by "Cheap Signals" (surface dogmas like "doubled pawns are bad"). You calculate to preserve a cheap signal, missing the "Costly Signal" (the deep mechanic) that actually governs the system.

## Triggers (The "When")
- You feel stuck in a loop of candidate moves that all lead to the same result.
- Spending too much time on a position that doesn't feel critical.
- **Surface Contradiction:** When a move "looks" ugly structurally but "feels" right dynamically.
- **The Fight:** You feel you are in a "calculation battle" where the winner is simply whoever sees one move further.

## Remedies (The "How")
- "Inter-subjectivity." Ask: "What is the *story* of this game?" or "What is my opponent actually trying to achieve?"
- **Sun Tzu's Exit:** Ask "Is there a game being played here that my opponent doesn't even see?" 
- **The Reality Check:** If you are calculating, you are blind. Stop. Look for the **Deep Mechanic** (the dynamical reality). Once you see the "neuroparasite" in the position, the move becomes obvious.
- **Mechanical Empathy:** Stop "thinking" and start "talking." Ask your pieces what they need. If they are unhappy, your calculation is just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
- **Dynamic Valuation:** Ask "What does this structural 'defect' give me in terms of energy (files, diagonals, square control)?"
- Stop calculating and look for the *theme*.
