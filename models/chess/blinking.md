# Model: Blinking (Chess Sin #2)

## Type
Psychological / Awareness

## Description
Missing a change in the "trend" of the game. A lapse in concentration at a critical moment when the nature of the position shifts.

**Weighting Inertia:** "Blinking" is the failure to re-calculate the "Fermi weights" of the position after a bifurcation. You continue using a weight vector ($w$) that was optimized for the *previous* state of the system, leading to a catastrophic mismatch with reality.

## Triggers (The "When")
- A sudden sense of surprise or a "wait, what?" moment after an opponent's move.
- **Bifurcation Points:** Following a trade, a pawn structure change, or the move from middlegame to endgame.
- **The Automatic Move:** When you feel you can play "on autopilot" because the previous trend was so strong.

## Remedies (The "How")
- **The System Reset:** Whenever a bifurcation occurs (pawn break/trade), stop and ask: "Is this still the same game?"
- **Factor Re-weighting:** Explicitly ask: "What was important 2 moves ago, and what is the #1 priority now?" (e.g., "Attacking the king" shifts to "Promoting the d-pawn").
- Identify "Critical Moments." When the pawn structure changes, pieces are traded, or the king's safety is threatened, *slow down*.
- Re-evaluate the board state from scratch after every major exchange.
