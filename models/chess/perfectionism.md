# Model: Perfectionism (Chess Sin #6)

## Type
Psychological / Time Management

## Description
Trying to find the "best" move instead of the "practical" move. Usually leads to time pressure and exhaustion.

## Triggers (The "When")
- You have 3 minutes left and you're trying to calculate a 10-move forced mate that isn't there.
- Agonizing over two equally good-looking moves.

## Remedies (The "How")
- "The Practical Choice." A solid, "good enough" move that maintains the advantage is often better than a complex winning line you can't fully see.
- Use the clock as a guide for depth.

## Observations
