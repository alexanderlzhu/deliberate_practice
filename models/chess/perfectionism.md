# Model: Perfectionism (Chess Sin #5)

## Type
Psychological / Time Management

## Description
Trying to find the "best" move (Surface Truth) instead of the "practical" move (Systemic Solution). It is the failure to realize that the "best" move is a function of the time remaining on the clock.

## The State Conflict: Flow vs. Deliberate Practice
- **Match State (Flow):** Goal is performance. You must trust your "automated" skill set.
- **Practice State (Deliberate):** Goal is growth. You must obsess over correction and "Truth."
- **The Sin:** Perfectionism is the "Practice State" hijacking the "Match State." You try to calculate to the bottom of the "Truth" while the "Time" resource is expiring.

## Triggers (The "When")
- **The Search for "The Win":** Agonizing over a forced mate when a simple, safe simplification is +5.0.
- **Clock Blindness:** Spending 10 minutes on a move in a position where there are three "good enough" candidates.

## Remedies (The "How")
- **"Good Enough" is the Truth:** In a match, the move that keeps you in control of the clock and the board is the "best" move, even if an engine finds something 0.2 better.
- **Trust the Automation:** If you can't see the "Truth" in 2 minutes, it's not "True" for you today. Play the most active move you *can* see and move on.
- **MTQ Balancing:** Realize that as **Time (T)** drops, you must lower your **Quality (Q)** requirement to maintain the **Material (M)** and the win.
