# Model: Egoism (Chess Sin #5)

## Type
Psychological / Prophylactic

## Description
Seeing the game only from your perspective. Forgetting the opponent is a "subject" with their own fears, plans, and agency.

## Triggers (The "When")
- Thinking "He *can't* do that" or "He *has* to play this."
- Surprised by an opponent's resource that you didn't even consider.

## Remedies (The "How")
- Prophylaxis. Spend 10 seconds of every move purely on the opponent's strongest response.
- "Put yourself in their shoes." What would make YOU uncomfortable in their position?

## Observations
