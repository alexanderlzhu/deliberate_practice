# Model: Egoism (Chess Sin #6)

## Type
Psychological / Social (Inter-subjectivity)

## Description
The failure to recognize that your opponent (or partner/counterparty) is an active, conscious agent with their own plans, fears, and agency. It is the sin of playing "Solitaire" in a two-player world.

## The Concept: Inter-subjectivity
- **Subjectivity:** "I see the world through my eyes."
- **Inter-subjectivity:** "I see the world through my eyes, AND I see that you see the world through yours."
- **The Sin:** Egoism is a collapse of inter-subjectivity. You treat the opponent's pieces (or a romantic partner's needs) as static objects to be manipulated rather than dynamic forces to be respected.

## Triggers (The "When")
- **The "Solitaire" Mindset:** Focusing entirely on your own attacking plan ("I'm doing X") without asking "What is he doing?"
- **The "Harmlessness" Filter:** Assuming the opponent's moves are mistakes or "bluffs" because acknowledging them would disrupt your own narrative.
- **Social Blindness:** In dating or business, assuming others want what *you* want (e.g., assuming a partner values the same things you do).

## Remedies (The "How")
- **The "Red Flag" Protocol:** Every move the opponent makes is a "message." Stop and translate it: "What is the *meaning* of this move from their perspective?"
- **Prophylaxis:** Preventive medicine. Fix the problem *before* it happens by addressing the opponent's plan while it is still a "ghost."
- **The "Dating" Test:** If this position were a person, would I be listening to them or just waiting for my turn to speak?
- **Beginner's Mind:** Throw away your "expert" interpretation of why their move is bad. Ask: "What if they are right and I am wrong?"
