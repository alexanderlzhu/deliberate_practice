# Gap: Materialism (Matter vs. Energy)

## The Mystery
Why do I feel "safe" when I am up material, even when my "Coordination" (C) is low and my "Energy" (E) is fading?

## Current Model Failure
The model of "calculating the evaluation" fails to account for the **Emotional Weight of Matter**. I find it physically difficult to believe that a +1 material advantage can be worth less than an abstract "initiative" (Energy).

## Predictions (Scientific Method)
1. If I intentionally enter a "Sveshnikov-style" structural disadvantage for activity, my "Egoism" will try to revert to a defensive "Materialist" posture.
2. I will consistently miss "Energy-based" sacrifices against "Pushers" because I am looking for a "Matter-based" win.
