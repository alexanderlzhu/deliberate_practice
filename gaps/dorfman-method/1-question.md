# Gap Investigation: Dorfman's Method and Dynamical Systems

## The Question
How can Iossif Dorfman's "The Method in Chess" be formally deduced from and integrated into Dynamical Systems theory?

## Background
Dorfman's method revolves around:
1. **The Static Balance:** An evaluation of king safety, pawn structure, material, etc.
2. **The Dynamic/Static Decision:** If the static balance is unfavorable, you *must* seek dynamic play.
3. **Regressive Search:** Determining the goal state and working backward.

## The Gap
While Dorfman's method is a powerful heuristic, it is often taught as a set of rules. This investigation aims to treat it as a **mechanical audit** of a dynamical system, providing a "first principles" derivation of his rules.
