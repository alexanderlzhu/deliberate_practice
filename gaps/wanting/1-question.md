# Gap: Wanting (The Influence of Desire)

## The Mystery
Why does the "desire for a result" consistently override objective calculation and evaluation, even when the player is aware of the phenomenon?

## Current Model Failure
The current model identifies "Wanting" as result-oriented thinking, but fails to explain:
1. The physiological transition from objective analysis to "hope-chess" or "fear-chess."
2. Why certain positions (e.g., winning advantages) trigger this more than others.
3. How to differentiate between healthy competitive drive and destructive "Wanting."
