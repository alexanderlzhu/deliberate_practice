# Hypothesis: Weighting Lag at Bifurcation Points

## Hypothesis
"Blinking" is caused by **Weighting Lag**—a failure to update the relative importance (weights) of positional factors at a bifurcation point.

## Mechanism
1. **The Linear Phase:** The player has a functional model (e.g., "Bishop pair is my primary advantage").
2. **The Bifurcation:** A trade or break occurs (e.g., the bishops are traded for knights and the center opens).
3. **The Lag:** The player continues to play as if the bishop pair (the old weight) is the priority, failing to see that "King safety" or "passed pawns" is now the dominant mechanic.
4. **The Blunder:** A move is made that is "logically" consistent with the old system but "mechanically" fatal in the new one.

## The Deep Mechanics Connection
If the player were "Talking to the Pieces," the pieces would tell them their needs have changed. "Blinking" is effectively a failure to perform a mechanical audit during a phase transition.
