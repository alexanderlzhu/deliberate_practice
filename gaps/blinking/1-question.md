# Gap Investigation: Blinking (Sin #2)

## The Question
Why do I fail to perceive "Critical Moments" or "Trend Changes" in a game, leading to a disconnect between my strategy and the new reality of the board?

## Background
Jonathan Rowson defines "Blinking" as missing a change in the trend of the game. It’s a lapse in concentration at the exact moment the nature of the position shifts. Examples:
- Continuing an attack after the queens are traded.
- Failing to realize a "slow" position has suddenly become "tactical."
- Playing "automatic" moves during a transition.

## Target Outcome
To develop a "Trend-Detection" trigger that forces a full re-evaluation whenever a systemic shift occurs.
