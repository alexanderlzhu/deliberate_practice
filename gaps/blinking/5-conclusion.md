# Conclusion: Blinking Gap Resolved

## Result: ACCEPTED & PROMOTED
The investigation confirms that "Blinking" is not a mere lapse in concentration, but a specific mechanistic failure called **Weighting Inertia**.

## Key Insights
1. **The Evaluation Function:** Positions are evaluated as a weighted sum of factors ($Eval = \sum w_i f_i$).
2. **Bifurcation Points:** Critical moments (trades, breaks, transitions) are bifurcations in the dynamical system where the optimal weight vector ($w$) changes radically and non-linearly.
3. **Weighting Inertia (The Sin):** "Blinking" occurs when a player carries the $w$ vector from the previous system state into the new one. They are solving the "wrong" version of the game.
4. **The Fermi Remedy:** The antidote is to use the **Fermi Method** at every bifurcation point—explicitly judging the new orders of magnitude for the weights (e.g., "Is king safety now 100x more important than this pawn?").

## Integrated Model
The **Deep Mechanics** model has been updated with the **Fermi Evaluation** tool, and the **Blinking** model is now defined as **Weighting Inertia**.

## Status
- **Model Promoted:** Updates to `Deep Mechanics.md` and `Blinking.md`.
- **Status:** Resolved.
