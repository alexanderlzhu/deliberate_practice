# Predictions: Strategic Inertia and Blinking

If "Blinking" is caused by Strategic Inertia, we should observe:

## Prediction 1: The "Surprise" Marker
**Claim:** A "Blinking" error will always be preceded by a feeling of surprise or confusion ("Wait, what?") after the opponent's move.
**Testable Event:** Tag moments of surprise in game reviews. Check if they follow a major transition you "ignored."

## Prediction 2: Post-Exchange Blindness
**Claim:** Most "Blinks" occur within 2 moves of a major piece trade or pawn structure change.
**Testable Event:** Analyze blunders. Do they cluster around structural transitions?

## Prediction 3: The "Automatic" Fallacy
**Claim:** Blinking is more likely to occur during "forcing" sequences where the player assumes they know the outcome of the sequence and stops looking at the board.
**Testable Event:** Compare error rates in forced vs. quiet positions.

## Prediction 4: Effective Intervention
**Claim:** Intentionally "resetting" the board evaluation after every major exchange will eliminate 80% of Blinking errors.
**Testable Event:** Use the "Fresh Board" mantra after every trade.
