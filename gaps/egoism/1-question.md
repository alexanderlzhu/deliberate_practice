# Gap: Egoism (Subjective Blindness)

## The Mystery
Why do I consistently "underestimate" opponent resources in blitz, even when I am technically capable of seeing the tactics?

## Current Model Failure
The general model of "not looking at the opponent's moves" is too shallow. It fails to account for:
1. **The Comfort Bias:** The desire to maintain the "harmless" interpretation of an opponent's attack to avoid the cognitive load of a messy defense.
2. **Blitz Time-Pressure:** How the lack of time forces a retreat into "solitaire" thinking.
3. **Selective Perception:** Filtering out moves that contradict my current plan.
