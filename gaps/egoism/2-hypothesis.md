# Hypothesis: The "Harmlessness" Filter

## The Model
Egoism in my games is not a lack of tactical vision, but a **defensive filter**. I categorize opponent threats as "harmless" because acknowledging them as "critical" would require me to:
1. Abandon my current offensive plan.
2. Accept a "Bifurcation Point" where the game becomes chaotic.
3. Burn significant clock time.

## Mechanism
When I see an opponent's attacking move, my brain performs a "Cheap Signal" check instead of a "Costly Signal" audit. I assume they are "bluffing" or "missing something" so I can remain in my own subjective narrative.
