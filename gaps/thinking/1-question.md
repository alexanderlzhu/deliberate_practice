# Gap Investigation: Thinking (Sin #1)

## The Question
Why do I engage in redundant or excessive calculation ("Thinking") in positions that require intuitive or thematic action?

## Background
Jonathan Rowson defines the "Sin of Thinking" as thinking when you should be *doing* or *feeling*. This often manifests as:
- Calculating "dead" or forced positions.
- Applying dogmatic rules to dynamic situations.
- Getting stuck in candidate-move loops.

## Target Outcome
To develop a trigger-response mechanism that identifies "Thinking" loops and switches to thematic/intersubjective evaluation.
