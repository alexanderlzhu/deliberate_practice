# Hypothesis: Thinking as a Defense Against Uncertainty

## Hypothesis
The "Sin of Thinking" is a psychological defense mechanism where over-calculation is used to avoid the "risk" of trusting intuition or thematic evaluation.

## Mechanism
1. **Uncertainty Trigger:** The position becomes complex or the "theme" is unclear.
2. **Surface/Deep Conflict:** A move that feels right (Deep/Intuitive) violates a dogmatic rule (Surface/Structural).
3. **The Shared Game Trap:** The player gets sucked into the opponent's "visible" game—a calculation battle where both players see the same surface threats.
4. **Anxiety Response:** Fear of the structural defect or losing the calculation battle leads to a refusal to "stop" calculating.
5. **The Loop:** Instead of switching to the "Unseen Game" (the story/theme), the player calculates variations in a fight they shouldn't even be having.
6. **Outcome:** Exhaustion, time pressure, and "Winning WITH Fighting" (at best) or "Losing via Blinking" (at worst).
