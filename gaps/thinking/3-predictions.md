# Predictions: Thinking as a Defense against Uncertainty

If the hypothesis is true (that Thinking is a defense mechanism against uncertainty), we should observe the following:

## Prediction 1: The "Loop" Trigger
**Claim:** In complex positions, calculation will not be linear but circular.
**Testable Event:** You will find yourself calculating the same 3-move sequence more than twice within a single turn.
**Falsification:** Calculation remains linear (new branches explored) even in high-stress positions.

## Prediction 2: The "Intuition" Delta
**Claim:** In positions where "Thinking" occurs, your initial intuitive move (the first move you liked) will be objectively equal to or better than the move chosen after 5+ minutes of calculation.
**Testable Event:** Record your "Move 0" (intuition) vs "Final Move". Compare engine evaluations post-game.
**Falsification:** Long calculation consistently finds significantly better moves (+0.5 centipawn or more) that intuition missed.

## Prediction 3: The "Intersubjectivity" Exit
**Claim:** Forcing a switch to "Intersubjectivity" (asking "What is the story?") will break the loop and lead to a faster, equally valid decision.
**Testable Event:** When the Loop Trigger (P1) occurs, intentionally stop and use the "Story" remedy.
**Falsification:** Switching to the "Story" leads to immediate tactical blunders that calculation would have caught.

## Prediction 4: Stress Correlation
**Claim:** "Thinking" frequency will increase when playing against higher-rated opponents or in "must-win" situations (Wanting).
**Testable Event:** Compare "Thinking" counts in casual games vs. rated/competitive games.
**Falsification:** "Thinking" occurs at the same rate regardless of external stakes or opponent strength.
