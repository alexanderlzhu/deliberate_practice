# Tests: Thinking Gap

## Test 1: The Intuition vs. Calculation Log
**Procedure:** Play 3 games (15+10 or 10+5). For any position where you calculate for >2 minutes, record the following.

| Game # | Move # | Intuition (Move 0) | Chosen Move | Evaluation Delta (Engine) | Loop Detected? |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------|----------------|
|        |        |                   |             |                           |                |

## Test 2: The "Story" Intervention
**Procedure:** In your next session, when you detect a "Loop Trigger" (calculating the same line 3x), force yourself to stop.
- **Intervention:** Use the Mantra: "The board doesn't know who is winning. What is the story of this game?"
- **Action:** Play the move that fits the story, not the calculation.

| Result of Intervention | Tactical Blunder? (Y/N) | Psychological State after move |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                        |                         |                                |

## Test 3: Stress Analysis
**Procedure:** Review 5 recent losses.
- Did the loss occur shortly after a period of heavy "Thinking"?
- Was the final blunder caused by time pressure generated by earlier "Thinking"?

| Game | Thinking Phase (Moves) | Blunder (Move #) | Connection to Thinking |
|------|------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
|      |                        |                  |                        |
