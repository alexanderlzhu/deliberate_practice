# Strategic Mental Consilience (Model-Centric)

This directory serves as an investigative deliberate practice journal. It applies the model-based discovery workflow from `corporate_crime_detective` to hobby mastery.

## Structural Design

- **`models/`**: Living repository of mental models, triggers, and remedies.
- **`observations/`**: Data points from sessions that support, contradict, or refine models.
- **`gaps/`**: Persistent weaknesses handled via the Scientific Method (Question -> Hypothesis -> Test).
- **`activities/`**: Activity-specific deconstruction (e.g., `chess/curriculum.md`).

## Operational Protocol: "The Investigative Practitioner"

1. **HYPOTHESIZE:** Before a session, select a **Model** to test (e.g., *Egoism*) or a **Gap** to investigate.
2. **OBSERVE:** During execution, watch for the **Triggers** defined in your models.
3. **ANALYZE:** Post-session, record a formal **Observation**. Link it to the model.
4. **REFINE:** Update the Model's **Remedies** or **Triggers** based on what actually worked.

## Templates
- `MODEL_TEMPLATE.md`
- `OBSERVATION_TEMPLATE.md`
